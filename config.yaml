# Multi-material IDEX/Toolchanger setup

# Leave empty for single-extruder printers (uses --material or auto-detection)
extruder_mapping:
  # T0: PETG   # Tool 0 - Uncomment and set your material
  # T1: PVA    # Tool 1 - Uncomment for support material
  # T2: PLA    # Tool 2 - Uncomment as needed
  # T3: ABS    # Tool 3 - Uncomment as needed

  # Example for IDEX with 4 tools:
  # T0: PETG   # Model material
  # T1: PVA    # Soluble support
  # T2: PLA    # Another model material
